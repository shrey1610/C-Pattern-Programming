This project is a C program that outputs the name "SHREYAS" to the console in a stylized manner.

Overview 
This software generates each letter in the name "SHREYAS" using custom functions, then formats and prints them to the terminal. 


Overview of the Code
The code is divided into multiple sections: 
Array Declarations : The patterns for every letter are stored in multidimensional arrays.
Gap Function : To improve readability, add spaces between letters.
Print function : Outputs the characters onto the keyboard.
Functions of Each Letter: Describe the style of each letter. 
Main Function : Prints the complete pattern after calling each letter's function separately. 

S
Gap() adds spaces to the letters spacing. 
printConsole() : This function outputs to the console the patterns kept in the arrays. S(), H(), R(), E(), Y() and A().
Define the patterns for the letters 'S', 'H', 'R', 'E', 'Y', 'A', 'S' respectively.
